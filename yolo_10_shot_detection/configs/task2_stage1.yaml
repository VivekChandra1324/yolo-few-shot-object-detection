# ===================================================================
# STAGE 1 CONFIG â€” TRAIN DETECTION HEAD (10-SHOT)
# Purpose: Initialize from a base model and focus training on the detection
#          head with most backbone layers frozen. Uses base_config defaults
#          unless explicitly overridden below.
