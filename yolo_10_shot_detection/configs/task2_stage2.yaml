# ===================================================================
# STAGE 2 CONFIG â€” FINE-TUNE MODEL (10-SHOT)
# Purpose: Resume from Stage 1 best checkpoint, unfreeze additional layers,
#          and fine-tune with a very low LR. Uses base_config defaults unless
#          overridden below.

# --- Stage-Specific Settings ---
# Note: Batch size is defined globally in base_config.yaml.
# freeze: Keep fewer layers frozen than Stage 1 to expose more capacity.
# lr0: Very low learning rate recommended for fine-tuning.
# max_phase_epochs: Upper bound per progressive phase (early exit may occur).
freeze: 20
lr0: 0.000067  # Re-scaled for the batch size of 512
